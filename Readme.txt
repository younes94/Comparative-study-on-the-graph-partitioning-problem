With the emergence of the concept of big data, we can see various developments at two levels: the first concerning innovative solutions and the second one, which affects the cost and
precision in the fields of information technology.

Currently, graphs are a strong support-model that facilitates the formalization of various problems, ranging from the simplest to the most complex.


The goal of research in NP-complete or NP-hard problems is focused on approximate solutions, focusing on approximation algorithms and heuristics as real and accurate solutions
become very expensive and difficult to use.

In this PFE, the main problem is considered a problem of partitioning graphs seen from a "big data" perspective, where massive graphs are partitioned into streaming. After a study and
analysis of a method chain, we will deal with several streaming partitioning models and then evaluate their performance levels on both theoretical and empirical levels.


Keywords: Graph partitioning, Streaming partitioning, Balanced graph partitioning, Heuristic
